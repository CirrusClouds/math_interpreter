# math_interpreter
A simple interpreter, basically a glorified calculator  right now
To use simply clone into a folder and run "python <folder_name>"
It begins a REPL that converts your expressions into python code and then evaluates them

Already done:
- Simple mathematical calculator following BIDMAS rules

To do next:
- List operations, more complex operations/functions
- Pretty terminal UI?
